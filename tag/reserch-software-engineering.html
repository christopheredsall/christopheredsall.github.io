<h2>Third conference of Research Software Engineers</h2>
<img alt="RSE Conference 2018 Banner Image" src="images/rse2018-narrower.png" />
<p>This year saw the <a class="reference external" href="https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/">Third Conference of Research Software Engineers</a> (RSEs). It was held at the University of
Brimingham on the 3rd and 4th of September. The conference was sold out with an
attendance of 314 delegates from twelve countries. The majority of the
delegates were from the UK representing a mix of academic institutions and
companies. As previously the format was two days with keynote talks and
parallel tracks of talks and workshops. This year there was an exhibition hall
where the sponsors had stands.</p>
<div class="section" id="day-1">
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>The conference programme kicked off with two keynote talks. The first was
from Eleanor Robson of UCL, titled &quot;<em>Nammu and Oracc: Digital Humanities
Software in the Sustainable Development of Iraqi History and Heritage</em>&quot;. This
was interesting in that the humanities are often underrepresented in these
sorts of events. Eleanor who is an expert in cuneiform writing described the
evolution of their <a class="reference external" href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/nammuandemacs/index.html">Nammu</a> editor,
the open corpus of cuneiform <a class="reference external" href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/index.html">Oracc</a>, and the benefits of working with
the RSE group at UCL.</p>
<p>The next keynote was by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/awf/">Andrew Fitzgibbon</a> of Microsoft
Research, one of the sponsors, titled &quot;<em>Building Computer Vision Systems That
Really Work</em>&quot;. Andy is an entertaining speaker and has a long CV of interesting
research that lead to products such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect">Kinect</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Hololens</a>. Unfortunately he didn't have
time to finish all of his talk, if the end was as good as the bits we did see,
we would have been in for a treat (as he would say).</p>
<p>After lunch the conference split in to parallel sessions. I went to the one
with the theme of software engineering. Tobias Schlauch from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10002/">DLR</a> followed up a
talk from last year with &quot;<em>Software Engineering Guidelines ‚Äì From Theory to
Practice</em>&quot;. The guidelines (in English) are found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1344612">http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1344612</a>. These provide checklists for evaluating
the maturity of a software project and guidance on which to apply depending on
the scale and distribution of the software. One comment from the audience is
that a similar/complementary set of guidelines are NASA's <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=49446977">Reuse Readiness
Levels</a> .
Benjamin Mort from Oxford's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">OERC</a> spoke on
&quot;<em>SIP: Prototyping the Science Data Processing for the Worlds Largest Radio
Telescope</em>&quot; the telescope is of course the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.skatelescope.org/">Square Kilometer Array</a>. Benjamin's talk interested me from an
architecture point of view and when the slides are available I would like to
take a closer look. For continuous integration (CI) they are using <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.com/SKA-ScienceDataProcessor/integration-prototype">Travis</a>. All
the info can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.skatelescope.org/books/">SKA book</a>. Dominik Jochym from STFC talked about
<em>CASTEP in &quot;A (Long) Tale of Academic Software Development</em> &quot;. The name
initially stood for Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package, it is apparently
&quot;none of those things now&quot;. For CI, after six years of experience with BuildBot
they have moved to an external (to the CASTEP group) service called <a class="reference external" href="https://anvil.softeng-support.ac.uk/">ANVIL</a> built on Jenkins. The final talk in
the session was Alex Meakins from UK AEA on &quot;<em>Modernising Data Access for the
JET Tokamak</em>&quot;. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/JET.aspx">JET</a> data is in a
proprietry in-house data format. This work is for an abstraction layer that
looks a bit like HDF5 and allows them to change the underlying format without
disturbing the consumers of the data.</p>
<p>The next session provided a dilemma
with three of my Bristol RSE colleagues presenting workshops at the same time.
Christopher Woods and Leter Hedges presented &quot;<em>Building and Deploying Custom
JupyterHub Images Using Docker and Kubernetes to Run Workshops in the Cloud</em>&quot;
and Matt Williams &quot;<em>Make Testing Easy with pytest</em>&quot;. In order to avoid playing
favourites I went to neither and instead attended the workshop by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-cownie-3939b1/">Jim Cownie</a> on &quot;<em>Getting More Python
Performance with Intel Optimized Distribution for Python</em>&quot;. There were
notebooks provided on the conference virtual machine image to work through that
showed simply replacing the standard python with the free (as in beer) Intel
one you can get a 47 times speedup on some problems.</p>

</embed><p>Earlier in the day Christopher Woods had announced the work on the
formation of the Society of Research Software Engineering which will place the
organisation on a better footing as a charitable organisation independent of
any particular university's procurement policies. At the end of the second day
we had the last of the informal AGM's under the association's old structure.
This was followed by a feedback and requirements gathering exercise for what
the members.</p>
<p>Afterwards was the conference dinner.</p>

<div class="section" id="day-2">
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>The first of the morning's keynotes was from James Howison of the University
of Texas &quot;<em>Challenges and Pathways to Sustainability in Scientific Software
Ecosystems</em>&quot;. This dug in to the definition of software maintenance which is
often thought of as one thing but in fact can be split in to three distinct
activities, he also examined where the value creating activities take place and
resource flows occur in the context of FOSS, commercial and grant funded
software development.</p>
<p>The sponsor keynote was by from DeepMind (Google)'s
Andreas Fidjeland &quot;<em>How Machine Learning and AI are Transforming Research</em>&quot;.
This covered their well known research in to deep learning approaches to the
game of Go with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. As I was one of the (millions) of
people who watched the games against Lee Sedol live on YouTube I was interested
to hear the story from one of the people involved.</p>
<p>After morning tea I went to the session themed &quot;<em>Techniques and
Technologies</em>&quot;. First up was Pashmina Cameron from Microsoft Research whose
talk &quot;Fast Code with Just Enough Effort&quot; gave useful strategies for speeding up
C++ code. Another talk to get the slides from once they are out. Julia Damerow
of Arizona State University's talk &quot;<em>Using Apache Kafka to Build a Modular Text
Extraction Platform</em>&quot; described a Pub/Sub based architecture they had developed
for researchers to extract embedded text from and OCR PDF documents for
researchers who aren't au fait with the command line. This was very relevant to
me as I have a user with a similar requirement. I talked to Julia afterwards
about this. Finally, Corentin Schreiber from the University of Oxford delivered
&quot;<em>Easy, Fast, and Robust Data Analysis with Modern C++</em>&quot; which was essentially
a sales pitch to encourage people who had tried C++ and were put off. The
message he was giving is that the language is much better now and the modern
features make it much easier to use.</p>

</embed><p>After lunch I went to the workshop on Julia given by one of the main
developers Valentin Churavy. Valentin promises &quot;The ease of use of python with
the speed of no less than half that of C&quot;. If you want to try it out without
installing anything you can use <a class="reference external" href="https://juliabox.com/">https://juliabox.com/</a>. Since we were targeting
the just released version 1.0.0 we used <a class="reference external" href="https://staging.juliabox.com/">https://staging.juliabox.com/</a>. I found
a reproducible crashing bug which I reported:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/29064">https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/29064</a>. We have some users of Julia at
Bristol and with the milestone of a 1.0 release I would expect more interest.</p>
<p>For the last session of the conference I went to the one themed &quot;<em>Scalable
Computing</em>&quot;. Andy Turner from EPCC highlighted the work or the RSE's and
challenges of managing a group distributed across many sites in &quot;<em>The DiRAC
Distributed RSE Group: Software from the Smallest to the Largest Scales</em>&quot;.
Matthew Hartley from the plant and microbial research institute the John Innes
Centre gave an entertaining talk titled &quot;<em>So, We Can Toss the Cluster in a
Skip, Right?</em>‚Äù describing their experiences with moving some of their
computing and data to the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Matthew Archer from Cambridge
gave a talk about large scale machine learning but I thought the presentation
at IPXUG on the same work was better. Finally Ardita Shkurti from STFC
described their experiences of using the AWS cloud.</p>

<div class="section" id="bonus-day-3-tier-2-rse-meeting">
<h3>Bonus Day 3: Tier 2 RSE Meeting</h3>
<p>A couple of communities took the opportunity of having a large number of
RSEs in the one place at the same time to hold add-on meetings. One of these
was the Citation Format Hack Day, the other, which I attended, was the Tier 2 /
Regional HPC Workshop. The programme was organised by James Grant who is the
RSE at the University of Bath who is associated with the GW4 Tier 2 system
Isambard. (For those unfamiliar with the tier-n nomenclature, the Branscomb
pyramid defines tier-0 as pan-national services, tier-1 as national resources
like ARCHER, and tier-2 as regional level services.)</p>
<p>Andy Turner (associated with Cirrus as well as EPCC) described the effort to
get reproducible benchmarks on HPC systems. The repos is at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks">https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks</a> (the build instructions aren't
included but can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hpc-uk/build-instructions">https://github.com/hpc-uk/build-instructions</a>).</p>
<p>Jon Gibson from NAG told us about the POP Centre of Excellence who provide
performance optimisation service for free. This was funded by the EU under the
Horizons 2020 program. While the original funding has ended there will be a new
funding round for three more years 2018 - 2021.</p>
<p>Mark Dawson who leads the RSE group at Swansea gave an overview of
Supercomputing Wales - Uwchgyfrifiadura Cymru (a follow-on to the HPC Wales
project) with a focus on the RSEs spread througout the country. They have now
filled all thirteen posts.</p>
<p>James Grant gave a review of the Isambard
hackathons and documentation that have taken place so far. Since I have been
involved in all of these there wasn't much news for me, but the approach might
be of interest to other tier-2 sites that want to develop closer links amongst
their RSEs. Phil Ridley from ARM gave a talk with hints and tips on porting to
the ARM architecture. This was good for me to see as I unavoidably had to miss
it when he gave the same talk in Bath six weeks ago.</p>
<p>Alan Simpson who ran the ARCHER Champions program facilitated a session with
a presentation about how that was run. Now that the funding has run out he is
looking to see how the community would like to take the program forward,
perhaps expanding it to &quot;HPC Champions&quot;, he is not wedded to the name, we could
call it anything. He wants it to be as inclusive as possible. If you have an
interest in HPC you can join. During the session he made use of Slido which he
had seen used earlier in the conference to solicit instant online feedback from
the group.</p>
<p>For the rest of the afternoon we split in to groups to discuss
the proposed topics and feed back to a plenary session. I chaired a group
discussing inclusivity.</p>
<p>A small number of us joined the other workshop for a &quot;networking session&quot; at
the university staff club.</p>
